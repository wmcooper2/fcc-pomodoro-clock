## Tech/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS

## Problems/Solutions
* Had issues getting the audio tag to work at first, but [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48748063/react-refs-audio-playback-unhandled-rejection-notsupportederror-on-ios) and [this one](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) helped me through it.
